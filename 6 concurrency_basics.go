		-different types of data are not allowed to transport from the same channel.
		- In the channel, the send and receive operation block until another side is not ready by default.

	/*-------------RANGE over Channels

	-Channels aren't like files; you don't usually need to close them. Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming, such as to terminate a range loop.

	The loop for i := range c receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.

	//If the channel has not been closed (by the sender preferably), this loop will create a deadlock situation

	//------------------Buffered Channels

	/*
		- We now know how channels are helpful in transfer of data between go routines.
		-Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel. Default buffers block when 1 element is sent. The element in the channel has to be received. Until then, we are in a blocking state
		-Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

		Length of the Channel: In channel, you can find the length of the channel using len() function. Here, the length indicates the number of value queued in the channel buffer.

		Capacity of the Channel: In channel, you can find the capacity of the channel using cap() function. Here, the capacity indicates the size of the buffer.

	*/

	//-------------SELECT STATEMENT

	/*
		- Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go because select lets us wait on MULTIPLE channel operations.
		- select: it is only used with channels.
		- A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready
		- In go language, select statement is just like a switch statement without any input parameter.
		-case statement refers to communication, i.e. BOTH SEND or RECEIVE operation on the channel.
		-Select statement waits until the communication(send or receive operation) is prepared for some cases to begin.
